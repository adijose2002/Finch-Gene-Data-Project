# Finch-Gene-Data-Project
For this project, I will work with a portion of this gene, known as ALX1, from four species, 5-10 individuals each, of Darwinâ€™s finches + 1 outgroup, L. noctis (the Lesser Antillean Bullfinch).
    Synthesizing Python knowledge: loops, conditions, strings, lists, functions, random functions, modules, plotting.
    DNA vs phenotype.
